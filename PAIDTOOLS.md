### A collection of the tools I am paying for

I am making this file to keep track of where I am spending money for development as well as share the tools that I find valuable enough to pay for.

 - [Medium](https://medium.com/) - I actually don't like Medium that much, but a lot of developers have their blogs there so I do pay $5/month in order to read their articles. I only go on Medium via search results (that is, I never go directly to medium.com).
