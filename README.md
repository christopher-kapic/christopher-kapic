I am a math and computer science at Northwestern University. I love building applications, especially with Node and React, but I am experimenting with other technologies as well. I'm currently preparing to graduate, and will soon be looking at developer jobs. If you are hiring, feel free to take a look at my [resume](https://blog.kapic.io/assets/PDF/Christopher_Kapic_Resume_(Lucario).pdf) and reach out to me.

### Things I am passionate about
 - Learning new technologies
 - Building web/mobile applications
 - Open source projects
 - Software startups

<!-- ## My First Project
[Cricky Calculator](https://simmer.io/@cricky14/cricky-calculator) üßÆ is a linear transformation demonstration tool inspired by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) created with Unity (back when I had no idea what I was doing). This is a messy project, but it has a special place in my heart as it was the project through which I was introduced to coding. -->
