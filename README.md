## My First Project
[Cricky Calculator](https://simmer.io/@cricky14/cricky-calculator) üßÆ is a linear transformation demonstration tool inspired by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) created with Unity (back when I had no idea what I was doing). This is a messy project, but it has a special place in my heart as it was the project through which I was introduced to coding.
